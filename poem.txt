The Consequences of Procrastination

Maybe I’ll start now
Maybe I’ll start Later
Maybe I’ll do it tomorrow
Maybe I’ll never do it
The regret you feel when the time comes
The pit in your stomach roars with rage
When your teacher looks
She gasps and stares at the blah on her screen
This could have been all avoided
If you just did it well and on time
